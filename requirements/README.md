# Web Game Engine — Requirements

This repository tracks the full requirements for a modern, extensible 2D web game engine and three showcase games (Super Snake, Advanced Tetris, Flappy Bird–like). These documents define scope, constraints, acceptance criteria, and a roadmap to guide implementation and validation.

## Goals

- Deliver a full‑featured, production‑ready 2D web game engine (TypeScript).
- Ship three polished showcase games demonstrating breadth of engine features.
- Ensure strong DX (documentation, typing, tooling) and smooth UX at 60 FPS on mid‑range mobile.
- Design for extensibility (plugin system), maintainability (tests, modular), and accessibility.

## Scope

- Platforms: Modern browsers on desktop and mobile. Primary: Chromium, Firefox, Safari.
- Graphics: WebGL2 (primary) with Canvas 2D fallback; optional WebGPU (behind a flag).
- Core: ECS, rendering, input, audio, scenes, assets, animation, physics/collision, UI overlay, particles, save/load, debugging, plugin API.
- Showcase: Three complete games with menus, sound, leaderboards (local), and polish.

## Non‑Goals (Initial)

- Full 3D rendering pipeline.
- Online multiplayer netcode.
- Custom desktop editor application.

## Deliverables

- Engine requirements, architecture, and API specs.
- Showcase game requirements for Super Snake, Advanced Tetris, Flappy‑like.
- Cross‑cutting: Performance budgets, compatibility matrix, testing/CI, documentation plan.
- Roadmap with milestones and acceptance criteria.

## Traceability

Each requirement includes an ID (e.g., ENG-RND-001) to aid traceability across docs, tests, and roadmap items.
