- Super Snake: classic snake with modern twists and polish.
- Advanced Tetris: fast, responsive, feature‑complete falling‑blocks.
- Flappy‑like: quick‑restart, precise control, juicy feedback.

Each game includes: full gameplay loop, menus, audio, animation, particles, save/load (scores and settings), pause, input remapping, and local leaderboards with replays. All rely solely on the engine’s public APIs.
