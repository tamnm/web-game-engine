# Super Snake — Requirements

## Vision

Fast, juicy, and replayable snake with multiple modes, power‑ups, skins, and reactive audio/visual polish.

## Core Gameplay

- SNA-FUN-001: Grid‑based movement with variable speed and wrap/solid wall modes.
- SNA-FUN-002: Food spawns with weighted rarity; combo multiplier for quick chains.
- SNA-FUN-003: Power‑ups: slow‑mo, ghost (pass through self for N turns), magnet, double score.
- SNA-FUN-004: Obstacles and dynamic hazards (e.g., moving blocks) per level theme.
- SNA-FUN-005: Multiple modes: Classic, Timed, Endless, Challenge levels.

## Controls

- SNA-CTL-001: Keyboard, touch swipe, and gamepad D‑pad/analog support; remappable.

## Presentation

- SNA-PRS-001: Smooth camera follow/zoom; pixel‑perfect mode option.
- SNA-PRS-002: Particle bursts on eat/collide; screen shake on big scores.
- SNA-PRS-003: Themed skins for snake, food, tiles; day/night variant.

## Audio

- SNA-AUD-001: Reactive music layers intensify with combo; sfx for eat, power‑ups, collisions.

## UI/Meta

- SNA-UI-001: Menus: main, mode select, settings, pause, game over.
- SNA-UI-002: Local leaderboards per mode; initials entry.
- SNA-UI-003: Replays saved and viewable from leaderboard.

## Performance

- SNA-PERF-001: 60 FPS on mid‑range mobile at grid 32x18 with particles.

## Acceptance

- All SNA-\* implemented; replays deterministic; wraps and wall modes behave as specified; leaderboards persist locally; input remapping persists.
